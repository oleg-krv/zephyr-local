config JSON_LIBRARY
	bool "Build JSON library"
	help
	  Build a minimal JSON parsing/encoding library. Used by sample
	  applications such as the NATS client.

config RING_BUFFER
	bool "Enable ring buffers"
	help
	  Enable usage of ring buffers. This is similar to kernel FIFOs but ring
	  buffers manage their own buffer memory and can store arbitrary data.
	  For optimal performance, use buffer sizes that are a power of 2.

config BASE64
	bool "Enable base64 encoding and decoding"
	help
	  Enable base64 encoding and decoding functionality

config PRINTK_SYNC
	bool "Serialize printk() calls"
	default y if SMP && MP_NUM_CPUS > 1
	help
	  When true, a spinlock will be taken around the output from a
	  single printk() call, preventing the output data from
	  interleaving with concurrent usage from another CPU or an
	  preempting interrupt.

config MPSC_PBUF
	bool "Multi producer, single consumer packet buffer"
	select TIMEOUT_64BIT
	help
	  Enable usage of mpsc packet buffer. Packet buffer is capable of
	  storing variable length packets in a circular way and operate directly
	  on the buffer memory.

if MPSC_PBUF
config MPSC_CLEAR_ALLOCATED
	bool "Clear allocated packet"
	help
	  When enabled packet space is zeroed before returning from allocation.
endif

config REBOOT
	bool "Reboot functionality"
	help
	  Enable the sys_reboot() API. Enabling this can drag in other subsystems
	  needed to perform a "safe" reboot (e.g. to stop the system clock before
	  issuing a reset).

config UTF8
	bool "UTF-8 string operation supported"
	help
	  Enable the utf8 API. The API implements functions to specifically
	  handle UTF-8 encoded strings.
