  This compatible binding should be applied to the device's iomuxc DTS node.
  the DTS node will be populated with all pinmux options for the specific SOC.
  These options can then be used in a pinctrl node with the "nxp,mcux-rt-pinctrl"
  compatible string to define pin groups.

  The user should not edit the bindings defined within this node to make pinmux
  selections, but should instead edit the pinctrl groups for their board.

compatible: "nxp,imx-iomuxc"

    - name: base.yaml

        An array of values defining the pin mux selection, in the following format:
        <mux_register, mux_val, input_reg, daisy_val, cfg_reg>
        mux_register: register that will be written to to make mux selection
        mux_val: value to write to mux_register
        input_reg: peripheral register that will direct peripheral signal to pin
        daisy_val: value to write to input_reg
        cfg_reg: register that will configure pin pull, drive strength, and open drain
